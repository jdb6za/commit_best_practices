This is the last Git commit tip for the week. You can find all the tips in this [autological](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/autological#English) repository: [commit_best_practices](https://github.com/jdb6za/commit_best_practices).

# Day 5 - This is Your History!
Your commits are a history of your work. You should think of them as an important first impression for reviewers and users of your code. They are also, with a little _diligence_, an invaluable resource for your future self and colleagues. Whether it is about a country, city, or person, histories say a lot about how we reached the current state of affairs. Likewise, your commit history is a self documenting story of how your code developed and changed over time. 

Make your commit history the best that it can be by writing concise ([Day 1](day_1_concise_commits.md)) explicit ([Day 3](day_3_be_explicit.md)) commits that read like a story ([Day 2](day_2_read_as_story.md)) while capturing your reasoning ([Day 4](day_4_capture_reasoning.md)). 

## Tips for Making a Great Commit History
- Take ownership of your commits 
  
  Decide to make writing good commit messages a priority and be diligent about it. 
- Learn from good examples

  While you are reading through repositories, look for ones with useful commit histories and emulate them in your commits.
- Get constructive feedback

  Writing useful commits is a learning process. As with anything that you are trying to improve, good feedback greatly speeds up the process.
- Make every commit count.

  This goes back to diligence. When it is late in the day, resist the temptation to write a throwaway commit that just saves your work. Instead, see each commit as an opportunity to tell your future self something useful.
