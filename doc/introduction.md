# Introduction
Hey there, with the beginning of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), now is a good time to step up your game with some Git commit best practices. I will be posting a tip each day this week that will help you write better commit messages. An organized commit history with well written commits is a great gift to your future self and colleagues.

These tips for writing good commit messages are for all projects and disciplines. Even if a project has its own requirements, these tips still apply. So, whether you are on a software team writing code every day or are just starting learning, these tips are for you. Furthermore, 

I am writing these tips to encourage growth and good software practices. These are just tips, they are not complete or perfect, but they are a good place to start. To help us all learn, please jump in with your experiential anecdotes and comments.
